## Problem: Building voice interfaces is hard.

To build a realistic voice interface, you have to orchestrate several pieces – 
speech recognition, AI/NLU for generating responses, and speech synthesis – 
in real time while managing the asynchronous and imperfect nature of human conversation.

The Vocode SDK arms developers with out-of-the-box tools that dramatically reduces the complexity
of building their own voice stack. It provides:
- Back-and-forth conversation orchestraction as a service
- One place for all of your integrations and the ability to swap out providers in a single line of code
- Cross-platform compatibility (web, mobile, telephony)

In essence, Vocode SDK focuses on all the voice and conversation related pieces so that developers
can focus on their core product.
